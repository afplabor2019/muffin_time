# Functional specification

**0. Executive summary:**

The goal of this system is to make life of companies and employees easier. It is not only a software, it is a tool. Everything is stored at one place, it can be accessed anywhere, anytime.  

**1. Goals and avoided things:**

It is a must to have the data saved in a very secure way, meanwhile it has to be easily accessed. Because it is safe some other things should be avoided. For example: accessing the data without the required permissions, or the ability of hacking the system. Every bug and safety feature must be applied immediately in order to protect the confidential data.

**2. Description of actualities:**

To make a system which fits the pipe-dream system written in the requirement specification. Our current goal is to make a web-based service which contains and manages all the data that can be found in the database. After logging in to the site the different roles are differentiated from each other. A simple user can log in to the site and manage its data, meanwhile an administrator can see all the logged in users, when they were logged in last time, email addresses and so on. 

**3. Pipe-dream system:**

When launching the application we are facing a form which must be filled with our username and password. There is no way to register from the outside, only the administrators can register new users. In the current version the administrators have only 2 functions: listing all users and creating a new user. The other functions are under construction. The simple users don't have any functions yet, but in the next update there will be a password and email changing function, and they can be invited in groups, which is managed by the foremen.
