# Project idea

The customer would like to have a safe login system.  
The system will be written in *PHP*, the data is stored in a *MySQL* database.  
There will be a default user for the customer, which has all the permissions.  
This user can *add a new user to the database* and it can *edit* and *delete* existing registered users.  
After successful login some functions will be available depending on one's permissions.
