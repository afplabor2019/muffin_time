*Meeting the customer, agreement about the details*

*Welcoming, getting on the subject*

***Customer:*** As we discussed about it earlier on email and on the phone I lead a confectionery business. We have so much order day by day that it got hard to organize them properly, the buyers are making complains that it take too much time to place an order. Thats why I'm asking your company to make an online shop which hopefully simplifies placing orders and the delivery.

***Developer:*** How would you like them to work exactly?

***Customer:*** First of all I would like to have a browsing menu that can be used without authentication with filters in order our buyer could choose from our supplies. If the user wants to place an order it must be available only after logging in to the shop, and providing its information (for eg. full name, address, mobile number and so on). 

***Developer:*** You mentioned that there should be a delivery option also. Would you like to have an option to pay in advance before the delivery is on the way?

***Customer:*** Yes, it would be good if there were payment options like credit card and pay on delivery. The delivery would have two options: by home delivery or picking it up in our shop.

***Developer:*** OK. Is there anything else that must get attention during the development?

***Customer:*** I would like to have the online shop user-friendly as possible. If the buyers have any question they could reach me. Beside that it should be flexible and easy to use.

***Developer:*** Fine, in the future if there is any question or idea feel free to contact us. We hope that our work will be efficient. There will be everything in the contract that we had talked about.
