# Project idea

We were requested to make an application for a sweet-shop in order to simplify making orders and choosing from their supplies. The system will be written in C# programming language using WPF and MVVM design pattern. Users can browse the webshop without a registration but for ordering the user must be registered. After that the user can log in and make the order.
