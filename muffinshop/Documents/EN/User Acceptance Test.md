### 1. Introduction

Our software development company seeks to create applications with the least bugs as possible. Of course this is a very hard task and impossible but we want to provide the best solution that we can. In order to make this happen we always test our applications. If there is a new module that has been written we make a testing period before it gets implemented in the release version. Testing is made by other members of the team
